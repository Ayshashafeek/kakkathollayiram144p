Based on our collaboration on the star-counting app, I can help you fill out the project documentation template.

Here is a developing version of it!

### kakkathollayiram

**Basic Details**

  * **Team Name:** Chill Dudes
  * **Team Members:**
      * **Team Lead:** Devinandha V R - Vidya Academy of Science and Technology,Thalakkotukara
      * **Member 2:** Aysha Shafeek M M - Vidya Academy of Science and Technology,Thalakkotukara
  * **Project Description:**
    The project, "kakkathollayiram," is a web-based application built to address the tedious task of counting stars in an image. It uses a custom-trained machine learning model, integrated into a web UI, to automate the star-counting process.

**The Problem (that doesn't exist)**
[How to do Star counting?]

**The Solution (that nobody asked for)**
[Since we are lazy to count by Ourself Let the AI Do it\!\!]

### Technical Details

**Technologies/Components Used**

  * **For Software:**
      * **Languages used:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
      * **Frameworks used:** No front-end framework (vanilla JS), Google Colab environment for backend execution.
      * **Libraries used:**
          * `tensorflow` and `keras` (for building and running the star-counting model).
          * `numpy` (for numerical operations on image data).
          * `Pillow` (PIL) and `io` (for image processing and handling image data from the web UI).
          * `IPython.display` and `google.colab.output` (for integrating the web UI into the Colab notebook).
      * **Tools used:** Google Colab, a modern web browser.
  * **For Hardware:**
      * No specific hardware was required, as the project runs entirely within the Google Colab cloud environment.

### Implementation

**For Software:**

  * **Installation:**
    The following libraries must be installed in the Colab notebook before running the code.
    ```
    !pip install tensorflow
    !pip install pillow
    !pip install numpy
    ```
  * **Run:**
    1.  Upload `index.html` and your trained model file (`your_model_path.h5`) to the Colab notebook session.
    2.  Copy and paste the final Python code into a cell.
    3.  Run the Python cell to display the user interface.

### Project Documentation

**For Software:**

  * **Screenshots:**

      * \![Screenshot1](Screenshot 2025-08-09 144817.png)
          * **Caption:** This screenshot shows the successful file structure with `index.html` and the other project files correctly located in the Colab session, resolving the `FileNotFoundError`.
      * 
          * **Caption:** This screenshot shows the user interface displayed within the Colab output cell. The "Processing image..." message indicates that the front-end has successfully called the Python backend to begin the star-counting process.
      * \![Screenshot3](Screenshot 2025-08-09 150646.png)
          * **Caption:** This screenshot shows the final UI with the layout centered and fully visible within the Colab notebook's output cell after the CSS was corrected.

  * **Diagrams:**

      * \![Workflow](Add your workflow/architecture diagram here)
          * **Caption:** The workflow shows the data flow from the user's browser to the Python backend and back again, all facilitated by the Google Colab environment.
